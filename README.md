# TFG-MANETS
In this Final Degree Project, a study of dynamic routing protocols in MANETs networks has been carried out. 
A series of mobility scenarios have been designed for the WiFi network emulator Mininet WiFi and a series of Python scripts have been designed
for the analysis of the data resulting from the tests. 
In this repository are uploaded the scripts and the data resulting from the aforementioned tests so that they can be read, studied and/or reused.
